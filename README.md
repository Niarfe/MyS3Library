# MyS3library
Quick set of scripts to store books out in s3

library used `pafy`, [link: pafy](https://pypi.org/project/pafy/)

it has a cli called ytdl, as described in the repo.

My script is a start, but the cli does the same thing.

Download the audio format, 128k, in m4a format

I can play them on mac using Quicktime, and I think these played on the mp3 player too?

Name on my download script is cleaned of spaces...

TODO: make scripts to push and search in s3... and turn this into my own SAP so I can listen to music at work! or
while programming!

Could also find an easier way to move the music through a lambda, but that's second step.
